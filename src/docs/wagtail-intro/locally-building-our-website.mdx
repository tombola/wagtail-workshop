 # Session 2 - Locally building our website


For demo purposes, I'm calling my site `mysite`.

Create a directory for our site
```bash
cd ~
mkdir mysite
cd mysite
```

## Install and run Wagtail

### Install dependencies

Wagtail supports Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

To check whether you have an appropriate version of Python 3:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If this does not return a version number or returns a version lower than 3.5, you will need to [install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Important:** Before installing Wagtail, it is necessary to install the libjpeg and zlib libraries, which provide support for working with JPEG, PNG and GIF images (via the Python Pillow library). The way to do this varies by platform—see [Pillow’s platform-specific installation instructions](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#external-libraries)

### Create and activate a virtual environment

We recommend using a virtual environment, which provides an isolated Python environment. This tutorial uses [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which is packaged with Python 3.

**On Windows** (cmd.exe):
```bash
python3 -m venv mysite\env
mysite\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**On Unix or MacOS** (bash):
```bash
python3 -m venv mysite/env
source mysite/env/bin/activate

```


**For other shells** see the [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

<p class="alert info">If you’re using version control (e.g. git), `mysite` will be the directory for your project. The `env` directory inside of it should be excluded from any version control, but we will set up the gitignore for this later</p>

### Install Wagtail

Use pip, which is packaged with Python, to install Wagtail and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install wagtail
```

### Generate your site

Wagtail provides a `start` command similar to `django-admin startproject`. Running `wagtail start mysite` in your project will generate a new `mysite` folder with a few Wagtail-specific extras, including the required project settings, a “home” app with a blank `HomePage` model and basic templates, and a sample “search” app.

Because the folder `mysite` was already created by `venv`, run `wagtail start` with an additional argument to specify the destination directory:
```bash
wagtail start mysite mysite
```

### Install project dependencies
```bash
cd mysite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures that you have the relevant versions of Wagtail, Django, and any other dependencies for the project you have just created.

### Create the database

If you haven’t updated the project settings, this will be a SQLite database file in the project directory.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create an admin user
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Start the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

If everything worked, [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) will show you a welcome page:

https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_1.png

![https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_1.png](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_1.png)

You can now access the administrative area at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)

https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_2.png

## Development

TODO The following example is for a blog, we should make this more relevant, like donation page or something

### Edit the homepage model

Out of the box, the “home” app defines a blank `HomePage` model in [`models.py`](http://models.py/), along with a migration that creates a homepage and configures Wagtail to use it.

Edit `home/models.py` as follows, to add a `body` field to the model:

```python title=home/models.py
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class HomePage(Page):
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)
```

Generate and run the migrations needed

The changes we just made will need to be applied to the database. Here we are adding a body field, so the database needs to be able to store the information we add to the body. We do this using the `./manage.py` file with the two following commands:

```bash
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
```

The above commands should do the following:

- make a new migration file at mysite/home/migrations/003_homepage_body.py
- Run the new migration file to populate or change the schema for the database

```bash title=output
(mysite-venv) kevin@mulder:~/shared/mysite/mysite
./manage.py makemigrations Migrations for 'home': home/migrations/0003_homepage_body.py
...
```

### What is the ./manage.py file and ./migrate?

The `manage.py` is a python file we use to execute administration tasks. When we run `./manage.py migrate` we are executing the django `migrate` method. This will create automatically create python files that define or adjust database schema. It saves us manually creating tables when we need them.

Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into. Read more about migration on the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/)

Make the body field editable

```python title=home/models.py
class HomePage(Page):
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)
    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('body', classname="full"),
    ]
```


Check your terminal to see if the site is still running, if it isn't, run

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

<p class="alert info">It's a good idea to have two terminal windows open whilest developing</p>

Go to the local site in your browser at 0.0.0.0:8000 or 127.0.0.1, or [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) (depending on local hosts setup)

From the admin menu select pages > home.

This will land you [http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/pages/3/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/pages/3/) which is your homepage. If there where child pages they would be listed here. Under the home title click 'edit' to edit the page. (note you can also do this straight from the admin menu by clicking page > then the small pencil icon.)

You should be on [http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/)

Add some body text and select publish from the bottom bar.

![edit homepage](../../images/edit_home_page.png)

### Update the template

Edit `home/templates/home/home_page.html` to match (remove it all and replace it with this):

```html title=home/templates/home/home_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ self.title }}</h1>
    {{ page.body|richtext }}
{% endblock %}
```


Your homepage title and field should now show on the root page of your local site at 0.0.0.0 / 127.0.0.1

## Create a blog app

<p class="alert info">An app refers to a submodule in our project. It's self-sufficient and not intertwined with the other apps in the project such that, in theory, you could pick it up and move it down into another project without any modification. An app typically has its own models.py. You might think of it as a standalone python module. A simple project might only have one app, whereas more complex projects or websites will have multiple apps that define deifferent models. E.G a news app defining a NewsPost model, a video app defining a VideoPage model etc.

If you find one app is solving two problems, split them into two apps. If you find two apps are so intertwined you could never reuse one without the other, combine them into a single app.
</p>

First we need to create the blog app. This is done via the `mange.py` file. It should be created at the site root:

```bash
./manage.py startapp blog
```

so your file structure should now be:
```bash
tree -L 1
.
├── blog # The blog app we just created
├── db.sqlite3
├── Dockerfile
├── home
├── manage.py
├── mysite
├── requirements.txt
└── search
```

To view your file structure like above, type `tree -L 1` if you are using Windows, Mac: `brew install tree` and then `tree -L 1`  Linux: `sudo apt-get install tree -y` followed by `tree -L 1`

The startapp command generated an app with some boilerplate files for us:

```bash
tree blog
blog
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── __init__.py
├── migrations
│   └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py
```

Now we need to enable the blog by adding it to our site settings. add `blog` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `mysite/settings/base.py`

```python title=mysite/settings/base.py
# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'home',
    'search',
    'blog',
...
```

**Define the model for the blog index page**

Edit `blog/models.py`:

```python title=blog/models.py
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)
    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
    FieldPanel('intro', classname="full")
]
```


Similar to what we did earlier, run `./manage.py makemigrations` and `./manage.py migrate`. This will add define the schema in our database for the blog.

After running this, go the the cms admin and add a child page to our homepage:

![add child to homepage](../../images/add_child_homepage.gif)

**Create a template for the blog index**

Make a file at `blog/templates/blog/blog_index_page.html` with this content:

```python title=blog/templates/blog/blog_index_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro|richtext }}</div>
        {% for post in page.get_children %}
            <h2>
                <a href="{% pageurl post %}">
                    {{ post.title }}
                </a>
            </h2>
            {{ post.specific.date }}
        {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

(Restart the local server if your template isn’t found by ctrl + c then ./manage.py runserver)

**Add a model for blog posts**

In `blog/models.py`:
```python
from django.db import models
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro', classname="full")
    ]


class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body', classname="full"),
    ]
```


Same again, run`./manage.py makemigrations` and `./manage.py migrate` to create the database changes

**Create a template for blog posts**

Make a file at `blog/templates/blog/blog_page.html` with this content:

```python title=blog/blog_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="meta">{{ page.date }}</p>
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro }}</div>
    {{ page.body|richtext }}
    <p><a href="{{ page.get_parent.url }}">Return to blog</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

Now we can add a blog page as a child of our blog index:

![add child to homepage](../../images/add_blog_child.gif)

Let's see what we have by going to our admin and checking the front end of the pages we created:

![blog index](../../images/blog_admin.gif)

## Improve the blog listing

Posts should be in reverse chronological order, and we should only list published content. Edit `models.py`, adding this `get_context` method to the `BlogIndexPage` class:

```python
def get_context(self, request):
    # Update context to include only published posts,
    # in reverse chronological order
    context = super(BlogIndexPage, self).get_context(request)
    live_blogpages = self.get_children().live()
    context['blogpages'] = live_blogpages.order_by('-first_published_at')
    return context
```


and update your blog index template to loop over `blogpages` instead of `page.get_children`.

[TODO Tolu - show how to change loop]

## Add an image to your blog post model

```python
# in the imports
from wagtail.images.edit_handlers import ImageChooserPanel

# in your BlogPage class
image = models.ForeignKey(
    'wagtailimages.Image',
    null=True,
    blank=True,
    on_delete=models.SET_NULL
)

# in your content_panels for BlogPage
ImageChooserPanel('image'),
```

Again, because we added a field to hold data... run `./manage.py makemigrations` and `./manage.py migrate`

## Update the blog post template to output images

```python
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags wagtailimages_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="meta">{{ page.date }}</p>
    {% image page.image fill-320x320 %}
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro }}</div>
        {{ page.body|richtext }}
    <p><a href="{{ page.get_parent.url }}">Return to blog</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

`fill` is just one of Wagtail's image resizing methods. Details of the others are listed in [the docs](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/topics/images.html). Try them out!

### Basic styling

TODO Maybe explain here templates and template inheritance?

Add [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) to `mysite/templates/base.html`, before `{# Global stylesheets #}`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.rawgit.com/necolas/normalize.css/master/normalize.css">
<!-- Tachyons CSS minified -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.10.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>
```

wrap the content block in a container div and add the tachyons classes to style the widths of the container:

{% block content %}{% endblock %}

Add some css styling to your custom css file at `[mysite]/static/css/[mysite].css`

I'm just going to make the body colour grey.

```css
body{
    background: #ccc;
}
```

## Committing our code to git

Create a .gitignore file in the project root and add the following

```bash
*.swp
*.pyc
.DS_Store
/.coverage
/dist/
/build/
/MANIFEST
/wagtail.egg-info/
/docs/_build/
/.tox/
/venv
/node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
*.idea/
/*.egg/
/.cache/
/.pytest_cache/
db.sqlite3
/media/
/static/
### JetBrains
.idea/
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
coverage/
client/node_modules
### vscode
.vscode
```

This will stop us committing files to git that we don't really need.

**Set up the project first in github**

Head to [github.com](http://github.com/) and create a repo for your code. I've called mine 'codersofcolor'

After creating your repo you will see some information:

![repo init](../../images/repo_setup.png)

We'll use this to add to our local repo so we can push code to github

now in the project root, we need to initialize the git repository, and add our first initil commit, and push the code

```bash
git init
git add . # the dot means all uncommitted files
git commit -m "Initial :tada:" # I just like emojis, that's what tada is.
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevinhowbrook/codersofcolor.git # replace your origin here
git push -u origin master
```

If all went well... when you go back to the github page and refresh, you should see all your code.

![repo init](../../images/repo_eg.png)

Task : Locally add a [README.md](http://readme.md/) file in the project root and push it up to github.
