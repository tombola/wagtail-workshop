 # Session 2 - Locally building our website


For demo purposes, I'm calling my site `mysite`.

Create a directory for our site
```bash
cd ~
mkdir mysite
```

## Install and run Wagtail

### Install dependencies

Wagtail supports Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

To check whether you have an appropriate version of Python 3:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If this does not return a version number or returns a version lower than 3.5, you will need to [install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Create and activate a virtual environment

We recommend using a virtual environment, which provides an isolated Python environment. This tutorial uses [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which is packaged with Python 3.

**On Windows** (cmd.exe):
```bash
python3 -m venv mysite\env
mysite\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**On Unix or MacOS** (bash):
```bash
python3 -m venv mysite/env
source mysite/env/bin/activate

```


**For other shells** see the [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

If you’re using version control (e.g. git), `mysite` will be the directory for your project. The `env` directory inside of it should be excluded from any version control, but we will set up the gitignore for this later

### Install Wagtail

Use pip, which is packaged with Python, to install Wagtail and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install wagtail
```

### Generate your site

Wagtail provides a `start` command similar to `django-admin startproject`. Running `wagtail start mysite` in your project will generate a new `mysite` folder with a few Wagtail-specific extras, including the required project settings, a “home” app with a blank `HomePage` model and basic templates, and a sample “search” app.

Because the folder `mysite` was already created by `venv`, run `wagtail start` with an additional argument to specify the destination directory:
```bash
wagtail start mysite mysite
```


### Install project dependencies
```bash
cd mysite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures that you have the relevant versions of Wagtail, Django, and any other dependencies for the project you have just created.

### Create the database

If you haven’t updated the project settings, this will result in a SQLite database file in the project directory.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

You will some output listing a set of steps django takes to setup a database with the tables wagtail will need.

### Create an admin user
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Start the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

If everything worked, [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) will show you a welcome page:


![https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_1.png](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_1.png)

This is already a working wagtail site!

****

You can now access the administrative area at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)


![https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_2.png](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.8/_images/tutorial_2.png)

## Development

### Edit the homepage model

Out of the box, the “home” app defines a blank `HomePage` model in [`models.py`](http://models.py/), along with a [migration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/) that creates a homepage and configures Wagtail to use it.

Edit `home/models.py` as follows, to add a `body` field to the model:

```python lineNumbers=true  title=home/models.py
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class HomePage(Page):
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)
```

### Generate and run the migrations needed

The changes we just made will need to be applied to the database. Here we are adding a body field, so the database needs to be able to store the information we add to the body. We do this using the `manage.py` file with the two following commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

The above commands should do the following:

- make a new migration file at mysite/home/migrations/003_homepage_body.py
- Run the new migration file to populate or change the schema for the database

```bash title=output
(mysite-venv) kevin@mulder:~/shared/mysite/mysite
python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'home': home/migrations/0003_homepage_body.py
...
```

### What is the manage.py file and migrate?

The `manage.py` is a python file we use to execute administration tasks. When we run `python manage.py migrate` we are executing the django `migrate` method. This will create automatically create python files that define or adjust database schema. It saves us manually creating tables when we need them.

Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into. Read more about migration on the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/)

At the moment we have a 'body' field on the homepage, but if you create a page in the admin interface you will not see any way to edit it. In order to make the body field editable we can add a `FieldPanel` to the list of fields that should be shown when editing the page.

```python lineNumbers=true  title=home/models.py
class HomePage(Page):
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)
    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('body', classname="full"),
    ]
```


Check your terminal to see if the site is still running, if it isn't, run

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

> It's a good idea to have two terminal windows open whilst developing

Go to the local site in your browser at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).

From the admin menu select pages > home.

This will land you [http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/](http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/) which is your homepage. If there where child pages they would be listed here. Under the home title click 'edit' to edit the page. (note you can also do this straight from the admin menu by clicking page > then the small pencil icon.)

You should be on [http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/](http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/)

Add some body text and in the bottom bar click on the arrow next to "Save Draft" and click "Publish".

![edit homepage](./edit_home_page.png)

### Update the template

Your homepage has now been stored in the database. At present `0.0.0.0:8000` still shows the dafault welcome page, rather than our new homepage, however. In order to display our content, we need a  template to show django how it should be presented.

Take a moment read through the [django documentation on templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/language/#templates) for an overview of how this works. 

Edit `home/templates/home/home_page.html`. Remove all of the current content (the welcome page) and replace it with the following:

```html title=home/templates/home/home_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ self.title }}</h1>
    {{ page.body|richtext }}
{% endblock %}
```


Your homepage title and field should now show on the root page of your local site at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

## Create a blog app

> An app refers to a submodule in our project. It's self-sufficient and not intertwined with the other apps in the project such that, in theory, you could pick it up and move it down into another project without any modification. An app typically has its own models.py. You might think of it as a standalone python module. A simple project might only have one app, whereas more complex projects or websites will have multiple apps that define different models. E.G a news app defining a NewsPost model, a video app defining a VideoPage model etc.
>
>If you find one app is solving two problems, split them into two apps. If you find two apps are so intertwined you could never reuse one without the other, combine them into a single app.

Because a blog has its own structure, with things like 'posts' and 'comments', it makes sense to separate those sorts of things into a blog specific app. This is done via the `manage.py` file. It should be created at the site root:

```bash
python manage.py startapp blog
```

so your file structure should now be:
```bash
.
├── blog # The blog app we just created
├── db.sqlite3
├── Dockerfile
├── env
├── home
├── manage.py
├── mysite
├── requirements.txt
└── search
```

To view your file structure like above, type `dir` if you are using Windows, and `ls` on Mac and Linux.

The startapp command generated an app with some boilerplate files for us (use `dir blog` or `ls blog` to view the files):

```bash
blog
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── __init__.py
├── migrations
│   └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py
```

Now we need to enable the blog by adding it to our site settings. add `blog` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `mysite/settings/base.py`

```python lineNumbers=true  title=mysite/settings/base.py
# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'home',
    'search',
    'blog',
...
```

**Define the model for the blog index page**

Edit `blog/models.py`:

```python lineNumbers=true  title=blog/models.py
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)
    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro', classname="full")
    ]
```


Similar to what we did earlier, run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`. This will add define the schema in our database for the blog.

After running this, go the the cms admin and add a child page to our homepage:

![add child to homepage](./add_child_homepage.gif)

**Create a template for the blog index**

Make a file at `blog/templates/blog/blog_index_page.html` with this content:

```python lineNumbers=true title=blog/templates/blog/blog_index_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro|richtext }}</div>
        {% for post in page.get_children %}
            <h2>
                <a href="{% pageurl post %}">
                    {{ post.title }}
                </a>
            </h2>
            {{ post.specific.date }}
        {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

(Restart the local server if your template isn’t found by ctrl + c then python manage.py runserver)

**Add a model for blog posts**

```python lineNumbers=true title=blog/models.py
from django.db import models
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro', classname="full")
    ]


class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body', classname="full"),
    ]

```


Same again, run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to create the database changes

**Create a template for blog posts**

Make a file at `blog/templates/blog/blog_page.html` with this content:

```python lineNumbers=true  title=blog/templates/blog/blog_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="meta">{{ page.date }}</p>
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro }}</div>
    {{ page.body|richtext }}
    <p><a href="{% pageurl page.get_parent %}">Return to blog</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

Now we can add a blog page as a child of our blog index:

![add child to homepage](./add_blog_child.gif)

Let's see what we have by going to our admin and checking the front end of the pages we created:

![blog index](./blog_admin.gif)

## Improve the blog listing

The template that we added for the blog index shows each of the 'child' blog post pages already, but we can improve on this. 

Posts should be in reverse chronological order, and we should only list published content. We will do this by adding a new variable to the 'context' that is passed to the template, and passing in a filtered and sorted list of blog posts, instead of just asking wagtail for all the child pages of that blog index.

Edit `models.py`, adding this `get_context` method to the `BlogIndexPage` class:

```python lineNumbers=true title=blog/models.py
class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro', classname="full")
    ]

    def get_context(self, request):
        # Update context to include only published posts,
        # in reverse chronological order
        context = super(BlogIndexPage, self).get_context(request)
        live_blogpages = self.get_children().live()
        context['blogpages'] = live_blogpages.order_by('-first_published_at')
        return context
```

Now we can update the blog index template to loop over `blogpages` instead of `page.get_children`.


```python lineNumbers=true title=blog/templates/blog/blog_index_page.html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro|richtext }}</div>
        {% for post in blogpages %}
            <h2>
                <a href="{% pageurl post %}">
                    {{ post.title }}
                </a>
            </h2>
            {{ post.specific.date }}
        {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

## Add an image to your blog post model

```python lineNumbers=true title=blog/models.py
# in the imports
from wagtail.images.edit_handlers import ImageChooserPanel

# in your BlogPage class
image = models.ForeignKey(
    'wagtailimages.Image',
    null=True,
    blank=True,
    on_delete=models.SET_NULL
)

# in your content_panels for BlogPage
ImageChooserPanel('image'),
```

Again, because we added a field to hold data... run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`

### Update the blog post template to output images

```python lineNumbers=true
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load wagtailcore_tags wagtailimages_tags %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="meta">{{ page.date }}</p>
    {% image page.image fill-320x320 %}
    <div class="intro">{{ page.intro }}</div>
        {{ page.body|richtext }}
    <p><a href="{% pageurl page.get_parent %}">Return to blog</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

`fill` is just one of Wagtail's image resizing methods. Details of the others are listed in [the docs](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/topics/images.html). Try them out!

## Basic styling


Although the basic content is being shown, it doesn't look great.

To get some styling in place that will make this blog a bit more presentable, we can add some CSS. To get us started with the minimum of effort, are going to use an existing CSS framework called [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/), rather than writing all the CSS ourselves. Add the following to `mysite/templates/base.html`, before `{# Global stylesheets #}`:

```html title=mysite/templates/base.html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.rawgit.com/necolas/normalize.css/master/normalize.css">
<!-- Tachyons CSS minified -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.10.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>
```

Wrap the content block in a container div and add the tachyons classes to style the widths of the container:

```html title=mysite/templates/base.html
<div class="container ph3 ph5-ns">
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</div>
```

Add some css styling to your custom css file at `mysite/static/css/mysite.css`

I'm just going to make the body colour grey.

```css
body {
    background: #ccc;
}
```

## Committing our code to git

Create a .gitignore file in the project root and add the following

```bash
*.swp
*.pyc
.DS_Store
/.coverage
/dist/
/build/
/MANIFEST
/wagtail.egg-info/
/docs/_build/
/.tox/
/venv
env
/node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
*.idea/
/*.egg/
/.cache/
/.pytest_cache/
db.sqlite3
/media/
/mysite/media/
/static/
### JetBrains
.idea/
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
coverage/
client/node_modules
### vscode
.vscode
```

This will stop us committing files to git that we don't really need.

**Set up the project first in github**

Head to [github.com](http://github.com/) and create a repo for your code. I've called mine 'codersofcolor'

After creating your repo you will see some information:

![repo init](./repo_setup.png)

We'll use this to add to our local repo so we can push code to github.

Now in the project root, we need to initialize the git repository,  add our first initial commit, and push the code to github.

```bash
git init
git add . # the dot means all uncommitted files
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevinhowbrook/codersofcolor.git # replace your origin here
git push -u origin master
```

If all went well... when you go back to the github page and refresh, you should see all your code.

![repo init](./repo_eg.png)

## Final task

Read through https://www.makeareadme.com/ and locally add/edit your [README.md](http://readme.md/) file in the project root and push it up to github. Take some time to consider what a good README should cover... you'll thank yourself later.
